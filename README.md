1. Identifying Inactive Customers: Pinpointed customers with no transactions in a year to aid re-engagement strategies. 📞
2. Transaction Summarization: Summarized monthly transaction totals per account to reveal financial trends. 💰
3. Branch Performance: Ranked branches by deposits to highlight top performers and areas for improvement. 🏦
4. Fraud Detection: Flagged suspicious accounts with frequent daily transactions for quick intervention. ⚠️
5. Customer Segmentation: Analyzed transaction amounts by age group to uncover spending patterns. 👥
6. Account Management: Evaluated account balances and behaviors to boost profitability and customer relations
